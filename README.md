This program uses PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to perform dimensionality reduction on the iris flower dataset. The goal of this program is to reduce the size of the dataset from 4 dimensions to 2 dimensions, making it easier to visualize and analyze.

Requirements
  1. pandas
  2. matplotlib
  3. sklearn
  
Usage
Install the required packages.
Download the pca_iris.data dataset file or provide the path to the dataset file in the url variable.
Run the program in a Python environment.
The program will output a scatter plot showing the reduced dataset in 2 dimensions.

How it works
The iris flower dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
The features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) are separated from the target variable (iris species).
The features are standardized using StandardScaler from the sklearn.preprocessing module.
PCA is performed with n_components=2 to reduce the dimensions from 4 to 2.
The reduced dataset is stored in a new pandas DataFrame and plotted using matplotlib.
The variance ratios are computed to show how much of the variance in the original dataset is preserved in the reduced dataset.
